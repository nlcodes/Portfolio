    <p>Hello! I'm Nathan, a self-taught developer who loves turning ideas into real, working solutions. My journey into software development really took off when I started building my own game from scratch. The process of designing pixel art, composing music, and writing code showed me how programming can bring creative visions to life. Through this project and countless hours of coding, I've built strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C. What drives me isn't just writing code, I also truly love solving problems that matter. Whether I'm crafting a smooth user interface, optimizing game mechanics, or building web applications, I focus on creating work that serves a purpose. I especially enjoy diving into challenging projects that push me to learn new approaches and technologies. When I'm not coding, I'm probably exploring the latest web technologies or tinkering with game development on my Linux system.</p>
