    <h2>About</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Voidland Engineer is a 2D sidescrolling adventure inspired by old school style games such as the original Super Mario Bros. A lot of love was put in to this project, in which almost all components were made by me (Nathan Lusk). All music, sounds, artwork, and most of the code was created by me (except for a few frameworks/modules). When I was younger, I used to make games in the programming language Scratch. I was never able to make exactly what I wanted to create, as I was quite young at the time. I thought it would be fun, as well as a good learning experience, to revisit coding games and to make a game without using an engine or any pre-made art.</p>
